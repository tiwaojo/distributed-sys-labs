Lab 3: Deploying a Circuit Breaking ambassador and a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)
Discussion Statement: Focus on the problem being solved by the pattern, how is it solved? and the requirements needed for the solution
Solution: Create a health monitoring endpoint within the application. This will check the applications storage & database availability as well as response time
Requirements:
The response code needs to be validated by the system
Errors should be detected through the given response
The system should measure response time to ascertain latency as well as execution duration
Check for expired server certificates

Discussion Statement:Summarize the problem, the solution, and the requirements for the pattern given in part1:
To guarantee that business requirements of applications are being met, tracking metrics like performance and availability is vital. Having the capabilities of fast reactions towards problems such as the service failing can significantly impact the profitability of a business. A solution to this is keeping track of a health monitor and storing a log of its state.
